<p>An opportunity to play with some real data. I downloaded some .csv's from Google Trends relating to watersports. Then I used JavaScript and later on some PHP to load and process the data. Chart.js was used to display the information visually. It was my first use of Chart.js, I found it fun.</p>

<p>The tech utilised includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML &amp; CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Chart.JS &amp; PHP</li>
</ul>
<p>You will see from the website how my understanding and usage of Chart.JS improved as the project progressed.</p>
