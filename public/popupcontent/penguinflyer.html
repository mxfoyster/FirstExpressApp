<p>A very silly but entertaining <b>Unity 3D</b> game where you must fly around and 'eat' the fish. This was a bit of a diversion whilst studying my Level 3 Coding practices.</p>

<p>The tech utilised includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>Unity 3D Hub</li>
   
</ul>
<p>It's all very basic. However, I find Unity makes it essential that you understand the basic principles of Object Oriented Programming. There is use of a Singleton in the form of a Game Manager (Controversail practice the Pro's may frown upon). Additionally there are some co-routines used (mostly for sound management).</p>

<p>I find Unity interesting because it moves you in another direction than simpler C derived projects with it's event loop. C# certainly makes life easier than C & C++ too with it's <i>automatic Garbage collection</i>. It's a nice and gentle introduction back into the world of OOP.</p>
