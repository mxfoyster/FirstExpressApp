<img class="pCentredImage" src="popupcontent/paddlelengthcpp.png" alt="Screen shot of my C++ Paddle Length project">
<p>An extremely basic WIN32 application that calculates the correct length for a Kayak paddle on given data. Programmed in DEV C++ with no visual environment.</p>

<p>The tech utilised includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>WIN32</li>
    <li>DEV C++</li>
   
</ul>
<p>It was nice to play with C++ again after many years and I found the Embarcadero IDE pretty good to use. Additionally, making an application using code without the advantage of a visual <i>'Click &amp; Play environment</i> was a good reminder of life before Visual Studio etc.</p>

<p>I would like very much to go back and play again with C++, perhaps do some simple console based programs, sort algorithms maybe? I called the repo 'Random Win App' because I literally had no clue what I was going to create when I started, I just wanted something in C++ and Win 32.</p>
