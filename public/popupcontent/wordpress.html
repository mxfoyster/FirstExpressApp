<p>Just a simple Wordpress blog using the 2017 template</p>


<p>I haven't played with Wordpress for many years. I thought it would be good to re-familiarise myself with it, there may be a future need within a commercial setting. Generally, I'm not a CMS fan. However, it's has it's uses and it's a good excuse to play around with someone else's code.</p>

<p>I have it set up as a kind of blog, detailing some of my projects and a bit about my kayaking. I will be playing around with it now and again, customising the template to my own needs.</p>
