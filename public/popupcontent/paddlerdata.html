<img class="pCentredImage" src="popupcontent/paddlerdata.png" alt="Screen shot of my Paddler Data project">
<p>A simple .NET 5 WPF project made in Visual Studio in C# and XAML. This potentially can be used for a paddlesports event to keep track of paddlers on the water and store basic information for each paddler.</p>

<p>The tech utilised includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>WPF</li>
    <li>XAML</li>
    <li>.NET 5.0</li>
    <li>XML</li>
   
</ul>
<p>My second WPF project, still quite basic but it includes some data management with persistence through the data being stored in XML format locally. I got a little more creative with the user interface, it's a little more fancy than my first app. I included some basic instructions and advice about GDPR regarding the app's use with regards to it storing personal data for a paddler.</p>
