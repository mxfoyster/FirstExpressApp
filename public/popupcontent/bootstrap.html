<img class="pCentredImage" src="popupcontent/bootstrap.png" alt="Screen shot of my Bootstrap website">
<p>This is a simple website where I played with bootstrap to see what it was like to use. Additionally, I played with PHP and MySQL using a test database I found online. It gave me the opportunity to make a sipmle API to communicate with the database and to construct simple widgets to sort and filter the data</p>

<p>The tech utilised includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML, CSS and Bootstrap</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>PHP & MySQL</li>
</ul>
<p>I found bootstrap quite simple to use, with enough time invested to familiarise myself with it further, it would be simple and fast to construct quite complex websites using it. The biggest downfall is the extra work required for overriding some of the set styles. For websites that are highly visually customised, it may be less efficient initially.</p>
