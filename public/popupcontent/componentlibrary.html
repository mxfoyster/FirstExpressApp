<p>I collected some code snippets from various past projects and turned them into a simple component library. The GitHub repository contains basic usage instructions within markdown files. Additionally, I have hosted the wesbite built into the project, giving further instructions and demonstrating each component </p>

<p>The components include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Plain HTML & CSS components</li>
    <li>HTML, CSS, Javascript and some PHP components</li>
    <li>A gallery viewer with zoom and drag capability</li>
</ul>
<p>The components are very simple, it's not a complex setup but it can grow in time and alongside being a fun project, I find it handy to look back on for reference purposes whilst doing other projects.</p>
