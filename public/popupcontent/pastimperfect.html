<p>A small business website for my stepmother's business. A "Full On" ecommerce website was not an option that matched the business model and there was no budget available for a website. I used my existing hosting to put together a simple site that showcases some of her work including items for sale. There are detailed instruction on how to purchase items or commission bespoke work.</p>

<p>The website uses a variety of different tech including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>HTML & CSS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>PHP & MySQL</li>
</ul>
<p>The source code for this website is not on GitHub for security and other personal reasons. Viewing it can be arranged under the appropriate circustances.</p>
