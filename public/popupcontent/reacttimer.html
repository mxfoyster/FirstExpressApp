<p>As my first React project, I chose to make a simple Timer component. I developed this on a local environment using Create-React-App and then hosted it live as a static site (link below).</p>

<p>This project advanced my skills in:</p>
<ul>
    <li>React and JSX</li>
    <li>CSS and Javascript</li>
    <li>NPX, NPM etc</li>
</ul>
<p>The timer component is created as an ES6 Class style component and is self contained (Excluding css) as a module that makes for easy importing into other React components / projects.</p>

<p>Overall, it's my first React project, I've learnt a lot and have no regrets. There is still much room for improvement. I still have a lot to learn. I'm loving the whole compononent centric style approach to React. It make it easier to create truly Abstract code that is easy to re-purpose later.</p>
