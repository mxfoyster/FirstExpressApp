<p>This was intended as a home for some Unity code I can recycle later. For now, it's just a rotating carousel UI and an Audio Manager with controls and some audio visualiser effects. Consider it like my Unity version of the <i>'ComponentLibrary'</i> project I did for web based stuff.</p>

<p>The tech utilised includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>Unity 3D Hub</li>
   
</ul>
<p>I really need to get back to this, I miss playing with Unity and even more, I miss the more rigid type structure within C#. I love JavaScript, however, catching problems with data types (and conversions between them) is much easier when your compiler enforces good practice.</p>
