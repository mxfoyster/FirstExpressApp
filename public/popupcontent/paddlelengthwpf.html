<p>After my WIN32 application, I decided to do the exact same Paddle Length Calculator in Visual Studio using WPF and C#.</p>

<p>The tech utilised includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>WPF</li>
    <li>XAML</li>
    <li>.NET 5.0</li>
   
</ul>
<p>When moving to this project from the C++ win32 project, it was truly shocking how much easier it was to make. The difference was astounding. I can see the attraction through the ability to create complex applications with minimal coding. The downside is the amount of <i>'Boilerplate'</i> code. There is a little of that in Win32, but much more here I thought. However, it's inevitable and productivity is incredibly important. I will still have a passion to create things 'from scratch' occasionally though. Vanilla JavaScript is useful for indulging that need.</p>
