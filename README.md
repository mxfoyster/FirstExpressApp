# FirstExpressApp
My first Node.js app that uses express.js

## Modules
I have decided against using the Express Generator. When trying it, the amount of mmodules it loaded as dependencies exceeded what I desired for a learning example. I'd rather learn in smaller chunks so as to understand what's going on "under the hood" more thoroughly.
